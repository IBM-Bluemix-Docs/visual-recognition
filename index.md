## Use cases

The {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service can be used for diverse applications and industries, such as:

- **Manufacturing:** Use images from a manufacturing setting to make sure products are being positioned correctly on an assembly line
- **Visual Auditing:** Look for visual compliance or deterioration in a fleet of trucks, planes, or windmills out in the field, train custom classifiers to understand what defects look like
- **Insurance:** Rapidly process claims by using images to classify claims into different categories.
- **Social listening:** Use images from your product line or your logo to track buzz about your company on social media
- **Social commerce:** Use an image of a plated dish to find out which restaurant serves it and find reviews, use a travel photo to find vacation suggestions based on similar experiences
