## GDPR in Visual Recognition
{: #gdpr-visrec}

### GDPR Security Migration
{: #gdpr-visrec-update}

- All {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionfull}} service instances created before **May 22, 2018** are not suitable for clients that require compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/679 (GDPR).

- Clients that are subject to GDPR need to migrate to a new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionfull}} service instance available on **May 22nd, 2018** and to adopt the new agreement for the {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionfull}} service.

- Clients will be required to provision a new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionfull}} service and generate *new authentication keys* to utilize the new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionfull}} service.

- If a client does not provision the new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionfull}} service, you confirm that IBM is not processing any Personal Data on the client's behalf that is subject to the GDPR.

- The existing {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionfull}} service will come to an end on the **October 1st, 2018** and clients who have not moved to the new service by this time will have their data deleted.

### Migration steps
{: #gdpr-visrec-steps}

A forthcoming update to the {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionfull}} service is planned that will effectively allow your previously trained custom models/classifiers to be available in your new service instance.

- You will first be required to provision a new instance of the {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service and generate new authentication keys for the new service.

- You will then use your prior and new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} plan service authentication keys to request the migration of your custom models to your new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service instance.

**IMPORTANT**: For customers using the SDK, you will need to update your SDK version to be compatible with the new authentication process.
