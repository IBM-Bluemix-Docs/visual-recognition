## Labeling and deleting data in {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}}
{: #gdpr-visrec}

### GDPR Security Migration
{: #gdpr-visrec-update}

- All {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionfull}} service instances created before **May 22, 2018** are not suitable for clients that require compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/679 (GDPR).

- Clients that are subject to GDPR need to [migrate to a new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service instance](migrate.html#migrating) available on **May 22nd, 2018** and to adopt the new agreement for the {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service.

- Clients will be required to provision a new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service and generate *new authentication keys* to utilize the new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service.

- If a client does not provision the new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service, you confirm that IBM is not processing any Personal Data on the client's behalf that is subject to the GDPR.

- Clients who do not move to the new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service between May 22, 2018 and October 1, 2018 will have their data deleted.

### Labeling data

If you need to remove an individual customer's data from a {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service instance with multiple customers, you first need to associate that data with a unique **Customer ID** for each individual that may have provided data. To specify the Customer ID for any data sent using the `POST /classifiers` method, include the **X-Watson-Metadata: customer_id** property in your header.

```bash
curl -X POST
--header 'X-Watson-Metadata: customer_id={ID-string}' \
--form "apple_positive_examples=@apples.zip" \
 "https://{HOST-URL}/visual-recognition/api/v3/classifiers?version=2018-03-19"
```
{: pre}

**Note**: Multi-byte characters are supported for the Customer ID string. Characters must be URL-encoded, both in the header during training, and in the query parameter during deletion. Only `_` is allowed; the list of special characters that are not supported is:

```\ | * { } $ - [ ] / ' ` " ~ ? ; < > ( ) ! & = % # ^ @ : . , + space```

**Note**: You are responsible for creating customer_ID values, and ensuring that each is unique.

### Deleting labeled data

Determine the date that your service instance was created by checking the host URL in your service credentials. Instances created **before** May 22, 2018 have a host URL of `gateway-a.watsonplatform.net . . .`, and need to migrate to a new {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} service instance.

To delete data for an individual, for service instances created **after** May 22, 2018, you provide the customer_id field=value pair to the `user_data` method.

**IMPORTANT**: Specifying a `customer_id` parameter will delete all data with that `customer_id` parameter across your entire {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} instance, not just within one application.

As an example, to delete user abc's data from your {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} instance, send the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -X DELETE
"https://{HOST-URL}/visual-recognition/api/v3/user_data?customer_id=abc&version=2018-03-19"
```
{: pre}

Each example returns an empty JSON object {}.

**Note**: Delete requests are processed in batches and may take up to 24 hours to complete.
